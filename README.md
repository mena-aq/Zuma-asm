# Zuma in x86 Assembly üê∏

A console-based recreation of the Zuma by Oberon Media, done in x86 Assembly Language utilising Irvine Library for graphics.
This was my final project for the Computer Organisation and Assembly Language course I took in my third semester. 

* Three Levels of increasing difficulty, with varying tracks!
* Power Ups like a slow-down ball
* Multiple screens including leaderboard for up to 5 players.
